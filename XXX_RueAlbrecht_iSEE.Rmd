## Overview {#workshop-overview}

### Description {#workshop-description}

This workshop demonstrates how to use the `r Biocpkg("iSEE")` package to create and configure interactive applications for the exploration of various types of genomics data sets (e.g., bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, CyTOF, gene expression microarray).

This workshop will be presented as a lab session that combines an instructor-led live demo, followed by hands-on experimentation guided by completely worked examples and stand-alone notes that participants may continue to use after the workshop.

The instructor-led live demo comprises three parts:

1. Brief lecture on the package concept and functionality
2. Overview of the graphical user interface
3. Instructions to preconfigure `r Biocpkg("iSEE")` apps

The hands-on lab comprises three part:

1. Inspection of single-cell RNA-seq data at various steps of a typical computational workflow, including quality control and dimensionality reduction
2. Addition of custom panels to the user interface for advanced visualization.
3. Additional questions from the participants, including individual use cases and suggestions for future developments

Participants are encouraged to ask questions at any time during the workshop.

### Pre-requisites {#prerequisites}

## Workshop {#workshop}

### Preparation of example scRNAseq data {#prepare-scrnaseq-data}

In this workshop, we use example data from the `r Biocpkg("TENxPBMCData")` package.
This package provides an _R / Bioconductor_ resource for representing and manipulating different single-cell RNA-seq data sets profiling peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) generated by [10X Genomics](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets).

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(TENxPBMCData)
```

The man page for the `TENxPBMCData()` function gives an idea of the datasets that are available from this package.
It can be opened with the following command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(TENxPBMCData)
```

Here, we use the `"pbmc3k"` dataset, which contains gene expression profiles for 2,700 single peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
The first time this dataset is loaded, this command downloads the dataset to a local cache, which takes some time, depending on the speed of your internet connection.
Subsequent times, the same command loads the dataset directly from the local cache.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sce <- TENxPBMCData(dataset = "pbmc3k")
```

At this point we can inspect the dataset in the console.

```{r}
sce
```

The dataset is provided as an object of the `SingleCellExperiment` class.
In particular, this summary view indicates that the following pieces of information are available:

- An assay matrix named `"counts"`
- Row names (i.e. genes) are Ensembl gene IDs
- Row metadata include for each gene the official gene symbol, and the gene symbol used by the
10x CellRanger quantification pipeline
- Column names (i.e., cells) are not initialized and left to `NULL`
- Column metadata include diverse information for each cell, including the cell barcode (`"Barcode"`) and the donor identifier (`"Individual"`).

Note that a `SingleCellExperiment` object (or, more generally, any `SummarizedExperiment` object) like this one already contains sufficient information to launch an interactive application instance to visualize the available data and metadata, using the `iSEE()` function.

For the purpose of this workshop, we first apply some preprocessing to the `SingleCellExperiment` object, in order to populate it with more information that can be visualized with `iSEE`.
The steps below roughly follow those outlined in the [_simpleSingleCell_](https://bioconductor.org/packages/simpleSingleCell) Bioconductor workflow.

We start by adding column names to the object, and use gene symbols instead of Ensembl IDs as row names.
In the case where multiple Ensembl identifiers correspond to the same gene symbol, the `scater::uniquifyFeatureNames` function concatenates the Ensembl ID and the gene symbol in order to generate unique feature names.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(scater)
colnames(sce) <- paste0("Cell", seq_len(ncol(sce)))
rownames(sce) <- scater::uniquifyFeatureNames(
    ID = rowData(sce)$ENSEMBL_ID,
    names = rowData(sce)$Symbol_TENx
)
head(rownames(sce))
```

Next, we use the `r Biocpkg("scater")` package to calculate gene- and cell-level quality metrics.
These metrics are added as columns to the `rowData` and `colData` slots of the `SingleCellExperiment` object, respectively.

```{r, message = FALSE}
MT <- rownames(sce)[grep("^MT-", rownames(sce))]
sce <- scater::calculateQCMetrics(object = sce, 
                                  feature_controls = list(MT = MT))
sce
```

We filter out a few cells with a large fraction of the counts coming from mitochondrial genes, since these may be damaged cells.
Notice the reduced number of columns in the dataset below.

```{r}
(sce <- sce[, sce$pct_counts_MT < 5])
```

Next, we calculate size factors and normalized and log-transformed expression values, using the `r Biocpkg("scran")` and `r Biocpkg("scater")` packages.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(scran)
library(BiocSingular)
sce <- scran::computeSumFactors(sce, min.mean = 0.1)
summary(sizeFactors(sce))
sce <- scater::normalize(sce)
```

In order to extract the most informative genes, we first model the mean-variance trend and decompose the variance into biological and technical components.

```{r}
logcounts(sce) <- as.matrix(logcounts(sce))
new.trend <- scran::makeTechTrend(x = sce)
fit <- scran::trendVar(sce, use.spikes = FALSE, loess.args = list(span = 0.05))
fit$trend <- new.trend
dec <- scran::decomposeVar(fit = fit)
top.dec <- dec[order(dec$bio, decreasing = TRUE), ] 
head(top.dec)
```

Next, we apply principal components analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to generate low-dimensional representations of the cells in our data set.
These low-dimensional representations are added to the `reducedDim` slot of the `SingleCellExperiment` object.

```{r}
set.seed(1000)
sce <- scran::denoisePCA(sce, technical = new.trend, BSPARAM = IrlbaParam())
ncol(reducedDim(sce, "PCA"))
set.seed(1000)
sce <- scater::runTSNE(sce, use_dimred = "PCA", perplexity = 30)
sce
```

Finally, we cluster the cells using a graph-based algorithm, and find 'marker genes' for each cluster as the genes that are significantly upregulated in the cluster compared to each of the other inferred clusters.
The adjusted p-values from this test, for each cluster, are added to the `rowData` slot of the object.

```{r}
snn.gr <- scran::buildSNNGraph(sce, use.dimred = "PCA")
clusters <- igraph::cluster_walktrap(snn.gr)
sce$Cluster <- factor(clusters$membership)
table(sce$Cluster)

markers <- scran::findMarkers(sce, clusters = sce$Cluster, 
                              direction = "up", pval.type = "all")
for (i in names(markers)) {
    rowData(sce)[, paste0("FDR_cluster", i)] <- 
        markers[[i]]$FDR[match(rownames(sce), 
                               rownames(markers[[i]]))]
}
sce
```

This concludes the preparation of the data.
We have now a `SingleCellExperiment` object that contains different types of abundance values, representations in reduced dimensions, as well as a range of row (feature) and column (cell) metadata.

We can launch an `iSEE` instance for exploring this data set using the `iSEE()` function:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(iSEE)
if (interactive()) {
    iSEE(sce)
}
```

The main argument to the `iSEE()` function is a `SummarizedExperiment` object, or an object of any class extending `SummarizedExperiment` (such as `SingleCellExperiment`, in this case).
No other restrictions are made on the type of data stored in the object, and `iSEE` can be used for interactive visualization of many different types of data.
It is also worth noting that for various types of data, Bioconductor packages provides functionality for directly importing quantifications generated by external software packages into a `SummarizedExperiment` object.
For example, the `r Biocpkg("DropletUtils")` package can read quantifications from the 10x Genomics CellRanger pipeline for single-cell RNA-seq data, and the `r Biocpkg("tximeta")` package can be used to read data from transcript quantification pipelines into a `SummarizedExperiment` object.

### Overview of the _iSEE_ package {#isee-overview}

<!-- Talk a bit about the usefulness of visualization. -->

This section provides an overview of the graphical interface of `iSEE` applications.
To follow along, make sure that you have launched an `iSEE` instance as described in the code block at the end of the previous section.
Note that in the default configuration, the panels do not look exactly like the ones shown in the screenshots below.
For example, data points are not immediately colored, and the default annotation variables displayed by each panel may differ.
Later sections of this workshop demonstrate how to modify the content of the panels and how they are displayed. 

Note that for simplicity, we typically refer to a `SummarizedExperiment` in this workshop; however, `iSEE` works seamlessly for objects of any class extending `SummarizedExperiment` as well (e.g., `SingleCellExperiment`, `DESeqDataSet`).
That said, some types of panels -- such as the `Reduced dimension plot` -- are only available for objects that contain a `reducedDim` slot (in particular, `SingleCellExperiment` objects); the basic `SummarizedExperiment` class does not contain this slot.
In this workshop, we refer to the rows of the `SummarizedExperiment` object as 'features' (these can be genes, transcripts, regions, etc) and to the columns as 'samples' (which, in our example data set, are single cells).

### The user interface {#user-interface}

The `iSEE` user interface consists of a number of panels, each displaying the data provided in the `SummarizedExperiment` from a specific perspective.
There are 8 standard panel types; 6 plot panels and 2 table panels, all showcased in the figure below.
In the default configuration, one panel of each type is included when launching the `iSEE` user interface.
However, users are free to rearrange, resize, remove or add panels freely, as described in a [later section](#configuration-ui).
We provide a brief overview of each panel type in the following subsections.

In addition to the 8 standard panel types, user can create custom panels (both plots and tables).
The creation and configuration of custom panels is discussed later, in a [dedicated section](#custom-panels) of this workshop.

<!-- This is perhaps not very pedagogical - the app will not look like the one below if it is just opened with the object created above.
But it's nice to show the capabilities of the panels too, not just the default settings.
I added a few sentences to the introduction of this section to try to address this. --> 

![](XXX_RueAlbrecht_iSEE/iSEEinterface.png)

#### Reduced dimension plot {#reddimplot}

The reduced dimension plot can display any reduced dimension representation that is present in the `reducedDim` slot of the `SingleCellExperiment` object.

Note that this slot is not defined for the base `SummarizedExperiment` class, in which case the user interface does not allow the inclusion of panels of this type.
 
![](XXX_RueAlbrecht_iSEE/redDimPlot.png)

#### Column data plot {#coldataplot}

The column data plot can display one or two of the provided column annotations (from the `colData` slot).
Depending on the class of the selected annotations, the panel shows either a Hinton diagram [@Hinton1991-hintondiagram; @Bremner1994-hintonplots], a violin plot, or a scatter plot.

![](XXX_RueAlbrecht_iSEE/colDataPlot.png)

#### Row data plot {#rowdataplot}

Analogous to the [column data plot](#coldataplot) above, the row data plot displays one or two of the provided row annotations (from the `rowData` slot).
Depending on the class of the selected annotations, the panel displays either a Hinton plot, a violin plot, or a scatter plot.

![](XXX_RueAlbrecht_iSEE/rowDataPlot.png)

#### Heat map {#heatmap}

The heat map panel displays, for any assay, the observed values for a subset of the features across the samples.

![](XXX_RueAlbrecht_iSEE/heatMap.png)

#### Feature assay plot {#featassayplot}

The feature assay plot displays the observed values for one feature across the samples.
It is also possible to plot the observed values for two features, in a scatter plot.

![](XXX_RueAlbrecht_iSEE/featAssayPlot.png)

#### Sample assay plot {#sampassayplot}

Analogous to the [feature assay plot](#featassayplot) above, the sample assay plot shows the observed values for all features, for one of the samples.
It is also possible to plot the observed values for two samples, in a scatter plot.

![](XXX_RueAlbrecht_iSEE/sampAssayPlot.png)

#### Row statistics table {#rowstattable}

The row statistics table displays all information provided in the `rowData` slot of the `SummarizedExperiment` object.

![](XXX_RueAlbrecht_iSEE/rowStatTable.png)

#### Column statistics table {#colstattable}

Analogous to the [row statistics table](#rowstattable) above, the column statistics table displays all information provided in the `colData` slot of the `SummarizedExperiment` object.

![](XXX_RueAlbrecht_iSEE/colStatTable.png)

#### 'Data parameters' collapsible box {#data-parameters-box}

Each plot panel type has a `Data parameters` collapsible box.
This box has different content for the each panel types, but in all cases it lets the user control the data that is displayed in the plot.

![](XXX_RueAlbrecht_iSEE/colDataPlotDataParams.png)

#### 'Visual parameters' collapsible box {#visual-parameters-box}

In contrast to the `Data parameters` collapsible box that lets users control _what_ is displayed in the plot, the `Visual parameters` box lets users control _how_ the information is displayed.

This collapsible box contains the controls to change the size, shape, opacity and color of the points, to facet the plot by any available categorical annotation, to subsample points for increased speed of plot rendering, and to control how legends are displayed.

![](XXX_RueAlbrecht_iSEE/colDataPlotVisualParams.png)

#### 'Selection parameters' collapsible box {#selection-parameter-box}

The `Selection parameters` collapsible box provides controls to transfer selections of points (features or samples) between panels.

We discuss point transmission in more detail [later in this workshop](#transmit-point-selections).

<!-- TODO: Link "later" to the appropriate section when it exists -->

![](XXX_RueAlbrecht_iSEE/redDimPlotSelectionParams.png)

#### Additional controls {#additional-controls}

At the top-right corner of the iSEE application, users can find additional controls for reproducibility, configuration and help.
Each of these is discussed in more detail later in this workshop.

### Configuration of the app interface {#configuration-ui}

As mentioned above, the default behaviour of the `iSEE()` function is to launch an instance of the user interface that displays one panel of each of the standard types.
However, in some cases it is desirable to have multiple panels of the same type, and/or exclude some panel types.

In order to accommodate such situations, users can add, remove, change the order of and resize all panels via the `Panel organization` menu in the top-right corner.

**Action:** Using your open `iSEE` instance, click on this menu and try to add and remove panels, and resize the existing ones.
By clicking in the selectize box listing all current panels, you will be presented with a drop-down menu from which you can choose additional panels to add. 
Similarly, panels can be removed by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-times"></i> icon associated with the panel name.

Each panel can be individually resized by changing the width and height. 
Remember to click on `Apply settings` to apply the changes you have made to the interface. 
Note that the total width of a row in the interface is 12 units.
When the width of a panel is greater than the space available, the panel is moved to a new row.

It can take a great amount of time to achieve a satisfactory panel configuration.
To avoid the need to manually organize the panels each time the app is opened, `iSEE` offers the possibility to export the current panel settings.

**Action:** click on the wrench icon in the top-right corner, and select 'Display panel settings'.
Scroll to the end of the code in the popup window and copy the definition of the `initialPanels` variable.

For example:

```{r}
initialPanels <- DataFrame(
    Name=c("Reduced dimension plot 1", "Column data plot 1", 
           "Row data plot 1", "Heat map 1", 
           "Feature assay plot 1", "Sample assay plot 1", 
           "Row statistics table 1", "Column statistics table 1"
        ),
    Width=c(3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L),
    Height=c(460L, 460L, 460L, 460L, 460L, 460L, 460L, 460L)
)
```

**Action:** Close the application, run the code that you just copied in your _R_ session, and relaunch the application, now with the additional argument `initialPanels` set:

```{r}
if (interactive()) {
    iSEE(sce, initialPanels = initialPanels)
}
```

Notice how the panel configuration at startup is now identical to the one you saw just before displaying the panel settings.

Now that we have an application consisting of a suitable collection of panels for our data set, we'll explore the collapsible boxes below each plot, which lets us control their appearance. 

#### Displaying a different reduced dimension representation {#choose-reduced-dimension}

By default, each _Reduced dimension plot_ displays the first reduced dimension representation provided (contained in the `reducedDim` slot of the `SingleCellExperiment` object). 
If additional reduced dimension representations are included, the one chosen for the display can be changed in the `Data parameters` collapsible box in the _Reduced dimension plot_ panel. 

**Action:** Use this control to show the t-SNE representation instead of the PCA. 

#### Coloring points by row/column annotation {#color-by-annotation}

With default settings, all points are colored black. 
However, any provided row (for features) or column (for samples) annotation can be used to color the points. 

**Action:** To demonstrate this, open the `Visual parameters` collapsible box in the _Reduced dimension plot_ panel, and set `Color by:` to `Column data`. 
Scroll through the dropdown menu that appears to see all the sample annotations that can be used to color the points. 
All these values are taken from the `colData` slot of the provided object. 
First, color the cells by `Cluster`, which contains the cluster labels that were assigned to the cells in the preprocessing step [in a previous section](#prepare-scrnaseq-data).
Note how a discrete color scheme is selected, since the variable is categorical. 
Next, color the cells by the log10-transformed number of detected genes (`log10_total_features_by_counts`). 
Notice how the color scale is now continuous. 
`iSEE` allows precise control over the color schemes used. 
More information about this can be found in the `ExperimentColorMap` vignette. 

#### Coloring points by feature value {#color-by-feature}

In addition to coloring cells by the provided annotations as above, we can also color them by the observed values for a given feature (as provided in one of the `assays`).

**Action:** Set `Color by:` to `Feature name` in the _Reduced dimension plot_, and select one of the genes from the dropdown menu. 
You can search for a gene of interest by typing in the dropdown box.
You can also choose which assay should be used to extract the values to color according to. 

#### Highlighting a single point {#highlight}

The `Color by: Sample name` option in the _Reduced dimension plot_ can also be used to highlight a single sample. 

#### Changing the shape and opacity of points {#change-shape-opacity}

By default, only the `Color` options are displayed in the `Visual parameters` box.
Additional controls can be shown by clicking the check boxes for `Shape`, `Points`, `Facets` and `Other`.
The `Shape` and `Points` panels let you set the shape and size of points according to provided annotations (or to resize all points), and to set the point opacity.
Here, you can also downsample points to increase the speed of rendering, which can be useful for data sets with large numbers of points.

#### Changing the displayed metadata {#change-metadata-displayed}

The _Column data plot_ and _Row data plot_ panels are used to display the information in the `colData` and `rowData` slots of the `SummarizedExperiment` object.
These panels can display either one or two annotations.
By default, the first annotation in the respective metadata table is selected.

The plot layout adapts automatically to the type of annotation(s) displayed.

* When all chosen annotations are categorical, `iSEE` displays a Hinton plot, consisting of rectangles with an area proportional to the number of observations they represent.
* For a single continuous variable, or one continuous and one categorical variable, `iSEE` uses violin plot(s).
* If two continuous variables are chosen, `iSEE` displays a scatter plot.

As a side note, categorical variables with "too many" unique values (which is typically the case for sample IDs, for instance) are represented as numeric variables, by replacing each value by an index. 
The limit for what is considered "too many" unique values can be set using `options(iSEE.maxlevels = 30)`. 

**Action:** Explore the different types of plots provided in the Column data or Row data plot panels by selecting different annotations as the `Column of interest (Y-axis)` and/or setting `X-axis:` to `Column data` and selecting an additional annotation.

#### Displaying the expression distribution of a single gene {#display-single-gene}

### Linking panels and transmitting point selections {#transmit-point-selections}

<!-- Examine panel chart -->

### Saving and restoring the state of the application {#save-and-restore-user-interface}

<!-- Copy the entire 'Display panel settings' code, close and reopen app -->

### Custom panels {#custom-panels}

<!-- Here we could mention the custom coverage plot, and link to bulk RNA-seq data -->
<!-- Multiple selections -> DE -->
<!-- If time is enough: Kev's comparison of reduced dimensionality could be also nice - just to show, maybe, and then link to the iSEE_custom repo -->

### Reproducibility {#reproducibility}

<!-- Code export -->
<!-- Config export! -->

### Sharing and communication {#sharing-tours}

<!-- Tours -->
<!-- If there is enough time: draft a mini tour live (challenging: anchors might be tricky - rewarding: once it works, it is surely a OOOH thing) -->
